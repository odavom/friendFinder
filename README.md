# friendFinder

Come on and find your new friend. Just click the button to take the survey!

The user is required to enter their name and a link to a photograpah.

Then the user answers 10 questions. Each question is measured on an agreement scale from 1 through 5. 

The numeric value of each question is then compared to the numeric value of each question of each individual in the database. You're new friend will be the user with the least amount of difference.
